    <h1>GOLDEN RETRIEVER</h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>The <b><i>Golden Retriever</i></b> is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and
            affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most
            frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and
            obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.</p>
        <p>
            The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth
            century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red
            Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during
            the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <hr>
        <P>
            The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later
            to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and
            some other British dog breeds.Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had
            been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of
            the breed.
            In the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his
            Scottish estate Guisachan.He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called
            Nous; Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all
            black-coloured litter.Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred
            Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents.It is the pedigree of Nous
            that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever.One early account
            claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a
            cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy.The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred
            by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.
